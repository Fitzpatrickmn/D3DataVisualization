Data Journalism using d3.js:

A project centered around data-driven storytelling and interactive data visualization. Uses HTML, JavaScript and d3.js to visualizations concerning health markers and poverty levels, to assess the health risks facing particular demographics. Data was presented as a CSV from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

Please visit https://fitzpatrickmn.github.io/D3DataVisualization/ for full display. 
Feel free to play around with the indicators as the diplay is interactive.

To visualize different data segments, please select from the various headings of Poverty (%), Age (Median), Household Income (Median), Obesity (%), Smokers (%), and Without Healthcare (%). Each selection shifts the State data represented in circles on the graph. The circles themselves can be hovered over to view the specific values for that state.
